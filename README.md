# PV cleaning robot simulation
A simple simulation using the python library *turtlebot* for the development of a a solar panel cleaning robot with dirt detection tools.

## Assumptions
Within the file **texto.txt** are some useful assumptions made for the simulation to run.

## Workspace
In this repository are different python files that were used as tests before the implementation of the final script which is **robot_simulation.py**. To test the final product you should only run this script. Additionally, it is posible to make a point identification of the image by just uncommenting a few described lines.
